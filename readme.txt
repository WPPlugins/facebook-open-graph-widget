Adds a Facebook Like widget including meta data to the page header. Configure to "like" individual pages or the entire blog.

== Description ==

Adds a sidebar widget to Facebook pages so that users can use Facebook to "Like" a page, post or blog.

The plugin takes care of adding the Facebook header information.

In order to add this widget to Facebook you must be a member of Facebook. The widget will not appear unless you set your 
Facebook ID in the widget options. Your Facebook id is the long number that Facebook uses to identify you, or you can use your unique username if you have one. If you can't find your user id, try looking in your photos. I found mine in the url to the albumns.

You have to include an image for the Facebook page. This should be the web address of an image or icon that you use to describe your page and it is subject to the Facebook rules for size and format.

The widget will allow a user to either "like" your website home page, or the individual pages in your website. You can select if you want just the main page to be liked. This makes it easier to administer your facebook pages. If you want individaul pages and posts to be liked and treated as separate Facebook pages then select posts and Pages. 

You can optionally include your geocode information and your contact information. I would be careful with your email address as it is in plain text for the spambots to harvest. If you need your users to contact you, and you have a good spam filter, you should include this information.

Includes styling settings. You can specify width, height and color scheme. You can use recommend instead of like and change the font. Use the dark color scheme if you have a dark background on your site. If you want a small button select button count and don't display faces.
